1. $$If\ M_{1}\ men\ can\ do\ W_{1}\ work\ in\ D_{1}\ days\ while\ working\ T_{1}\ hours/day\ and\ at\ E_{1}\ efficiency,$$ $$then\ \frac{M_{1}*D_{1}*T_{1}*E_{1}}{W_{1}}=\frac{M_{2}*D_{2}*T_{2}*E_{2}}{W_{2}}$$
2.  If A can do a piece of work in x days and B and do the same piece of work in y days then together they will do the same work in $$\frac{xy}{x+y}\ days$$
3. If A, B, C can do a piece of work in x, y, z day respectively then all three can finish the piece of work in $$\frac{xyz}{xy+yz+zx}\ days$$
4. If A and B together can do a piece of work in x days and A alone can do it in y days, then B can do it alone in $$\frac{xy}{y-x}\ days$$
 **Hint: Always try to calculate according to amount of work done per day (1/days) instead of putting days in equation directly**

**Note: solve more problems of 2 bodies coming towards each other, find point of contact etc**
