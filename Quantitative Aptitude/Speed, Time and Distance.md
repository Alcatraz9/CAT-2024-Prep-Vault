Meeting for first time:
if a and b in opposite direction: at time T = l/(a+b)m/s 
At starting point: at time T = LCM(l/a, l/b)

Number of meeting points:
let a/b be x/y in lowest form
if a and b in opposite direction: no of meeting points = x+y
if in same direction: |x-y|

Races:
P, Q start at point A to race to B 100m away.
i)P finishes 10m ahead of Q: 100m/Sp = 90m/Sq
ii)P finishes 10s ahead of Q: Sp(t) = Sq(t+10)
