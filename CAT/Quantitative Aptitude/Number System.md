1. $$1+2+3+...n = n(n+2)/2$$
2. $$1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + \dots + n^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{2}$$
3. $$1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 + \dots + n^3 = (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2$$
4. Sum of first n odd numbers = n^2
5. Sum of first n even numbers = n(n+1)
6. Highest power of **n** in **m!** = $$[\frac{m}{n}] + [\frac{m}{n^2}]+[\frac{m}{n^3}] + \dots$$
Ex: No of zeroes in 23! = $$\frac{23}{5} = 4 (Ans)$$
7. Sum of all possible distinct permutations formed by using n distinct integers = $$(n-1)!*\left( \sum allDigits \right)*(11111\dots.n-times)$$
8.  If a number can be represented as $$N = a^p*b^q*c^r$$ Then number of factors of N =$$(p+1)(q+1)(r+1)$$ **If the number of factors is odd, then N is a perfect square**  
	 Sum of all factors = $$\frac{a^{p+1}-1}{a-1}*\frac{b^{q+1}-1}{b-1}*\frac{c^{r+1}-1}{c-1}$$ Product of all factors = $$N^{\frac{number\ of\ factors}{2}}$$ Assuming a=2, the number of even factors of N = $$p (1 + q) (1 + r) . . .$$ The number of odd factors of N = $$(1 + q) (1 + r)…$$

9. Suppose a number N and if there are n factors including the number N and 1, then the number of pairs of factors would be n/2. If N is a perfect square, then the number of pairs (including the square root) is (n+1)/2. ![[Pasted image 20240529224308.png]]

11. Number of digits in $$a^b = [b\log_{m}(a)]+1$$ where m is base of number and [.] is G.I.F function

12. A number that is not a multiple of 4 cannot be expressed as a difference of 2 perfect squares
13. Last 2 digits of $$a^2, (50-a)^2,(50+a)^2, (100-a)^2\dots$$ are same
Example:$$Last\ 2\ digits\ of\ 268^2 = (250 + 18)^2 = \\last\ 2\ digits\ of\ 18^2 = 24$$
14. If number can be written as $$2^{10n}$$ i. if n is odd, last 2 digits are 24
	ii. if n is even, last 2 digits are 76
15. Prime numbers can be written in the form $$6K\pm1\ or\ 6K\pm5$$
16. 1 is not prime number
17. Pure recurring fractions:
	i. If a number is of the form of 0.ababab……. then divide the repeating digits with as many 9’s as we have repeated digits 
		Ex: 0.363636... = 36/99 = 4/11
	ii. If N = 0. abcbcbc…. Then N = abc - a/990 = Repeated & non Repeated digits - Non Repeated digits/ As many 9's as repeated digits followed by as many zero as non-repeated digits 
		Ex: 0.2575757... = (257 -  2)/990 = 255/990 = 17/66
18. Product of n consecutive numbers is always divisible by n!
